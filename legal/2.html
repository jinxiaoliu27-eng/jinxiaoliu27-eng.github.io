<p>Few rules for the ordering of Society have such a deep moral and re&#173;<br/>ligious influence as the principle of the sanctity of contracts:<i> Pacta sunt <br/>servanda.</i> In ancient times, this principle was developed in the Bast by <br/>the Chaldeans, the Egyptians and the Chinese in a noteworthy way. Ac&#173;<br/>cording to the view of these peoples, the national gods of each party took <br/>part in the formation of the contract. The gods were, so to speak, the <br/>guarantors of the contract and they threatened to intervene against the <br/>party guilty of a breach of contract. So it came to be that the making of <br/>a contract was bound up in solemn religious formulas1 and that a cult <br/>of contracts actually developed.2 <br/></p>
<p>For the Islamic peoples, the principle,<i> Pacta sunt servanda,</i> has also a <br/>religious basis: &quot;Muslims must abide by their stipulations.&quot; This is <br/>clearly expressed by the Koran in many places, for example, where it is <br/>said: &quot;Be you true to the obligations which you have undertaken. . . . <br/>Your obligations which you have taken in the sight of Allah. . . . For <br/>Allah is your Witness.&quot;8 <br/></p>
<p>With the peoples of the Mediterranean area, the common interest in a <br/>regulated commerce was added to the religious motive. The juridical <br/>sense of the Eomans recognized that a well-regulated trade was possible <br/>only if contracts were kept. Then, as earlier, contracts were considered <br/>as being under Divine protection. But their psychological basis then was, <br/>above all, the necessity of a legal regulation of international contractual <br/>relations.* <br/></p>
<p>Christianity exercised a great influence on the sanctity of contracts. Its <br/>basic idea demanded that one's word be kept, as is clearly expressed in the <br/>Gospel according to St. Matthew, in particular, where it is said, at Chapter <br/>5, Verses 33 to 37, at the end: &quot;Bu t let your communication be, Yea, yea; <br/>Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.&quot; Later, the <br/>Fathers of the Church set forth in detail the notion of the sanctity of con&#173;<br/>tracts. Thus St. Augustine (354-430), for example, taught that one must <br/></p>

<p>keep one's word even with one's enemies. The same idea is to be found <br/>in the<i> Decretum Gratiani.5 <br/></i></p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, after the Empire of Charles the Great was dissolved, <br/>when the unity of the will of the state was broken, the principle of vassalage <br/>acquired a decisive meaning. The feudal system involved a chain of con&#173;<br/>tracts, voluntarily entered into by lords and vassals, and the existence of <br/>such contracts alone prevented anarchy. The moral basis of feudalism <br/>may be found in the<i> miles christianus.</i> The Christian knight was required <br/>above all to be true to his given word.6 At the same time the study of <br/>Roman law was strengthening the concept of an obligation to perform con&#173;<br/>tracts. <br/></p>
<p>The Renaissance and the Reformation followed. The idea of the &quot;Rea&#173;<br/>son of Sta te&quot; was a basic one in the theories of Machiavelli (1469-1527). <br/>I t is true that he adhered unreservedly to the &quot;general value of religion, <br/>morality and law. ' ' 7 Nevertheless his political thought was influenced by <br/>the idea of necessity. He asserted that the Prince could put himself above <br/>law and justice, should this be necessary for the state. To be sure, <br/>Machiavelli said that the Prince ought, if he could, to follow the paths of <br/>goodness; but he was justified in doing wrong in cases of necessity. In <br/>order to protect the interests of the state, explained Machiavelli, the <br/>Prince must be ready to act &quot;against loyalty, against charity, against <br/>humanity and against religion.&quot; <br/></p>
<p>This was understandably grist to the mill of the adherents of power <br/>politics, who have always relied upon Machiavelli's teaching in order to <br/>justify their viewpoint. However, the direct influence that Machiavelli <br/>exercised upon contemporary thinking, especially in the field of interna&#173;<br/>tional law, should not be overestimated. The fact that Machiavelli, in <br/><i>II Principe</i> (first published in 1532) had broken with Christian ethics <br/>and taken up ancient heathen ideas prevented the spread of his teaching. <br/>Immediately afterwards, the minds of men were occupied to the highest <br/>degree with the religious contest which divided the Christian world, and <br/>&quot; the ancient and heathen State idealism of Machiavelli was no longer <br/>understood by the people of the time of the Counter-Reformation, even <br/>by the free-thinkers, who continued the secular spirit of the Renaissance.''8 <br/></p>
<p>Even the founder of the modern theory of sovereignty, Bodin&#8212;of whom <br/>more will be said below&#8212;can be described as an opponent of Machiavelli, <br/>as was shown in particular by Friedrich Meinecke. <br/></p>
<p>I t is certain, however, that Machiavelli's views were helpful to those <br/>who admitted exceptions to the sanctity of contracts. Thomas Aquinas <br/>(1225-1274), who on principle demanded that contracts be performed <br/>even with regard to enemies, had also said that, if the circumstances existing <br/></p>

According <br/>to the majority of writers, this doctrine is regarded as justified today,, <br/>however, only when the circumstances existing at the time of entering <br/>into contract have changed to such an extent that either contracting <br/>party has the right to demand the revision of the contract&#8212;a right which <br/>must be exercised in good faith. On the other hand, a unilateral right of <br/>termination or alteration does not exist. We must limit ourselves here <br/>to this general remark on the<i> clausula rebus sic stantibus,</i> for its discussion <br/>would go beyond the scope of this article. <br/></p>
<p>Even before Grotius, Jean Bodin (1530-1596) developed his famous <br/>theory of sovereignty. In his major work<i> De la Bepublique</i> (1577), he <br/>defined national sovereignty as the highest authority, independent of state <br/>laws, with respect to the citizens and subjects of the state<i> (summa in cives <br/>ac subditos legibusque soluta potestas).</i> He added that no one could bind <br/>himself through his own laws and that no law was so sacred that it could <br/>not be changed under the pressure of necessity. Nothing could be dis&#173;<br/>creditable, he said, which was connected with the welfare of the state.10 <br/></p>
<p>I t would seem easy to draw therefrom the conclusion that international <br/>agreements need not be kept if their performance is no longer in the inter&#173;<br/>est of the state. However, such a conclusion would be unwarranted. The <br/>following, at least, appears to be clear: Bodin set up his theory of sov&#173;<br/>ereignty in order to build up the complete autonomy of the French state <br/>as against the three Powers which, in the Middle Ages, threatened its <br/>independence, the Church, the Roman Empire, and the feudal lords.11 <br/></p>
<p>Far from wishing to deny that the sovereign is subject to legal rules, Bodin <br/>stated expressly that the Princes &quot;are all bound by God's law and also by <br/>the law of nature.&quot; The Prince must, above all, keep his word, he said, <br/>for &quot;fidelity and loyalty are the very bases of all justice. Not only the <br/>State, but the whole human community, is held together by them.&quot; Con&#173;<br/>tracts concluded with foreign countries, therefore, must also be faithfully <br/>performed. Even the danger of destruction cannot release the state from <br/>its contractual obligations. <br/></p>
<p>In the opinion of Jellinek, this theory of Bodin, and the political <br/>theories of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, are illogical. Jellinek wished <br/>to restrict, &quot; i n conformity with the spirit of the times,&quot; the sanctity of <br/>contracts for states, according to Bodin's concept of sovereignty, to such <br/>contracts &quot;which established a lasting situation<i> (e.g.,</i> treaties of peace or <br/>of cession) or which provided for a short period of performance by the <br/>State with the means at its disposal.&quot;12 He thought that a lasting <br/></p>

<p>restriction of the legislative and administrative powers of the state, as is <br/>frequently found in modern contracts, would amount to &quot; a n unacceptable <br/>surrender of sovereignty.&quot; If, however, Bodin's thought is adapted to <br/>its contemporaneous world setting, where there were no unions, nor any <br/>supra-national organizations, then it appears that Bodin's theory included <br/>all the international contracts which could be made at the time, and that <br/>his principle of the sanctity of contracts was not limited to a special kind <br/>of convention. <br/></p>
<p>I t is true that Bodin formulated exceptions to the rule, for instance <br/>&quot; i n cases where what you have promised is by nature unfair or cannot <br/>be performed.&quot; Such exceptions gave the supporters of power politics <br/>an opportunity for extensive interpretation.18 This is why Grotius found <br/>it advisable to argue, against Bodin's view, that &quot; the King himself cannot <br/>reverse a position previously established in the civil law or annul a con&#173;<br/>tract or release himself from his oath,&quot; if he has made it as head of <br/>state.14 These remarks show that Bodin's doctrine has scarcely been dis&#173;<br/>advantageous to international law and in particular to the sanctity of con&#173;<br/>tracts. Unlike Hegel's theory in the 19th century, that of Bodin did not <br/>misguide the science of international law. Already Franciscus Vitoria <br/>(1483-1546),&quot; and Francisco Suarez (1548-1617),16 among other prede&#173;<br/>cessors of Grotius, had laid much stress on the sanctity of contracts. <br/></p>
<p>In the 17th century, a new danger arose for the principle of sanctity <br/>of contracts from two great philosophers, Hobbes and Spinoza, the ex&#173;<br/>ponents of the doctrine of<i> raison d'Etat.</i> Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), <br/>the English philosopher of utilitarianism, expressed the idea, in particular <br/>in his<i> Leviathan,</i> that the holder of state power had an almost unlimited <br/>power. He considered as decisive not the principles of justice, but those <br/>of wisdom. Nevertheless, he recognized as natural law the principle that <br/></p>
<p>agreements are to be kept. The concept of wrong arises out of the <br/>non-performance of a contract, the promisor being therefore in con&#173;<br/>tradiction with himself. <br/></p>
<p>However, also according to Hobbes, agreements need not be kept if the <br/>security of the state so requires.17 <br/></p>
<p>The idea of the<i> raison d'Etat</i> was expressed even more favorably by the <br/>Dutch philosopher, Spinoza (1632-1677). In his<i> Tractatus Theologico-<br/>politicus</i> (1670), he said that <br/></p>
<p>no holder of State power can adhere to the sanctity of contracts to the <br/>detriment of his own country, without committing a crime. <br/></p>
<p>The words &quot; to the detriment of his country&quot; should be noted. I t follows <br/>that the sanctity of contracts depends upon whether the contract is bene&#173;<br/>ficial to one's own state. This is undoubtedly a rejection of the principle <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>1959] PACTA S U N T SERVANDA 779 <br/></p>
<p><i>Facta sunt servanda.</i> Therefore, Spinoza can in fact be described as a <br/>forerunner of Hegel. <br/></p>
<p>The followers of Grotius in the 17th and 18th centuries were unani&#173;<br/>mously in favor of the sanctity of contracts. The views of Samuel Pufen-<br/>dorf (1632-1694) and of Cornelius van Bynkershoek (1673-1743) are <br/>especially noteworthy in this connection. In his book,<i> De jure naturae et <br/>gentium</i> (1672), the former described as one of the inviolable rules of <br/>natural law that each man must keep his word without breaking it.18 The <br/>latter expressed the opinion that, without the principle of good faith and <br/>that of the binding force of contracts, international law would be en&#173;<br/>tirely destroyed.18 <br/></p>
<p>The principle of sanctity of contracts was brought out in strong relief <br/>by Emer de Vattel (1714^1767) in his famous<i> Droit des Gens</i> (1757). He <br/>devoted to this question a special section of his book, under the title <br/>&quot;Obligation to Keep Contracts.&quot; 20 He pointed out that nations and their <br/>leaders must hold fast to their oaths and their contracts, since no security <br/>and no commerce would otherwise be possible between nations. He men&#173;<br/>tioned on several occasions what he called the<i> &quot;foi des traites&quot;</i> (faith of <br/>treaties). Vattel meant here something more, as was shown by Ernst <br/>Eeibstein,21 than the mere sanctity of contracts between the contracting <br/>parties. He had the same thing in mind as Abbe&quot; de Mably (1709-1785), <br/>who, in his<i> Droit public de VEurope</i> (1748), referred to the trust that all <br/>Powers should and must create through the establishment of an objective <br/>legal order, even though limited to single states. <br/></p>
<p>As regards the application of the<i> clausula rebus sic stantibus,</i> Vattel, it <br/>should further be pointed out, urged the greatest caution: it would be a <br/>shameful misuse of the clause&#8212;in his opinion&#8212;if a contracting party took <br/>advantage of any change in the circumstances to release himself from his <br/>obligations. Nothing would then be left upon which one could rely.22 <br/></p>
<p>Johann Jacob Moser (1701-1785), the founder of the positivist school <br/>of international law, explained, in his<i> Grundsdtze des jetzt ublichen <br/>Europdischen Volckerrechts in Friedenszeiten</i> (1763),28 that contracts could <br/>only be canceled &quot;with the consent of all interested parties.&quot; <br/></p>
<p>In the age of Napoleon also the science of international law remained <br/>true to this principle. Reference should first be made here to Georg <br/>Friedrich von Martens (1756-1821) who explained, in his<i> Einleitung in <br/>das positive Volkerrecht, auf Vertr'dge und Herkommen gegriindet</i>24 <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>780 THE AMEEICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 53 <br/></p>
<p>a valid and binding contract creates, for nations and individuals alike, <br/>the complete right to demand from the other party the performance <br/>of the contract, so long as the contracting party, on his side, has per&#173;<br/>formed satisfactorily his obligations. <br/></p>
<p>The remarks of Johann Ludwig Kltiber (1762-1837) are also char&#173;<br/>acteristic in this respect; in his<i> Europaisches Volkerrecht</i> (1821),25 he <br/>devoted to the &quot;sanctity of contracts&quot; a special chapter in which he em&#173;<br/>phasized that the performance without breach of international contracts was <br/>a principle common to all nations and was required by the very purpose <br/>of the state. <br/></p>
<p>In the succeeding years the German philosopher, Georg Friedrich <br/>Wilhelm Hegel (1770-1831), exercised a strong influence on the thinking <br/>of the 19th century on international law. For him the law was a product <br/>of the will. The will of the nation was the carrier of the law. Contracts <br/>could be valid only so long as they contributed to the welfare of the state. <br/>Hegel placed the will of the state as the central point of all his observa&#173;<br/>tions.26 The influence of his theory on the German, Italian, English and <br/>French doctrine of international law has been clearly shown by Verdross.27 <br/></p>
<p>The objectionable manner in which the German scholar, August Wilhelm <br/>Heffter (1796-1880), expressed himself on the sanctity of contracts in his <br/>otherwise excellent book,<i> Das Europaische Volkerrecht der Gegenwart <br/></i>(1844), a book which was translated into many languages and had eight <br/>editions, is worth noting. While pointing out that the expression,<i> Pacta <br/>sunt servanda,</i> was a foremost principle of international law, he limited the <br/>scope of the principle as follows: <br/></p>
<p>one can scarcely disagree with the view that a contract in itself creates <br/>a right only through the union of wills<i> (duorum vel plurium in idem <br/>consensus)</i> and thus only for so long as this union exists.28 <br/></p>
<p>This observation prompted the editor of the last two editions of the work, <br/>F . Heinrich Geffcken, to add: <br/></p>
<p>but nevertheless for so long as the will of the contracting parties has <br/>bound them, unless there exists a special reason to justify a with&#173;<br/>drawal from the contract.28 <br/></p>
<p>Writers on international law could not for long fail to perceive that <br/>international law was being undermined, if one based contracts on the <br/>will of the state. They therefore tried to find a basis which would leave <br/>unaltered the principle of sanctity of contracts, in spite of a continued <br/>adherence to the will of the state as a foundation of international law. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>1959] PACTA SUNT SERVANDA 781 <br/></p>
<p>Thus Georg Jellinek (1851-1911), whose influence on the science of <br/>international law cannot be overestimated, rested the validity of interna&#173;<br/>tional contracts on the self-imposed obligation of states: <br/></p>
<p>The State can release itself of any self-imposed restraint, but only in <br/>legal forms and in creating new limitations. The restraint, but not <br/>the particular limitation, is permanent.30 <br/></p>
<p>It is, however, clear that the state, if its will is decisive in the last analysis, <br/>can release itself from a self-imposed obligation. If there is no higher <br/>will which compels the state to keep its word, then there is no sufficient <br/>basis given to the contract which obligates the state to observe it. For <br/>this reason, the theory of Jellinek is generally rejected today, and rightly <br/>so. <br/></p>
<p>Another attempt was made by Heinrich Triepel (1868-1946) to reconcile <br/>the doctrine of the will of the state with the rule,<i> Pacta sunt servanda, <br/></i>in his classical work,<i> Volkerrecht und Landesrecht</i> (1899). Eejecting <br/>Jellinek's theory of self-imposed obligation, he sought to show that the <br/>source of contracts was the common will of the contracting parties, &quot;which <br/>arises through interaction with the will of other States.''S1 However, <br/>this attempt to found the validity of an international contract upon the <br/>will of the contracting parties must also be described as a failure. For <br/>here also the binding character of a contract is based, not on a higher <br/>law, but on the will of the states, even if on the will of a majority of <br/>states. Moreover, the hypothesis of a &quot;common will&quot; is a mere fiction. <br/>It should be added that Triepel limited the application of his theory to <br/>agreements in the sense of law-making treaties<i> {&quot; traites-lois&quot;).</i> Above <br/>all, however, only a law which stands above the will of the state can <br/>create the binding power of contracts. <br/></p>
<p>Later on, the theory was abandoned that the validity of contracts, and <br/>of international law in general, rested on the national will of one or all of <br/>the contracting parties. Another basis was sought for the principle <br/><i>Pacta sunt servanda.</i> Thus Dionisio Anzilotti (1867-1950) described the <br/>principle of the sanctity of contracts as a hypothetical basic norm, which <br/>can be assumed but not proven.82 For Anzilotti the rule<i> Pacta sunt <br/>servanda</i> is the basic norm of all international law. It is clear, however, <br/>that this cannot explain the validity of customary law. Above all, the <br/>validity of contracts cannot rest upon a mere postulate. Anzilotti's at&#173;<br/>tempt shows, however, the great value attached by this prominent author <br/>and his.followers to the principle of<i> Pacta sunt servanda</i> as an integral <br/>part of international law. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>782 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 53 <br/></p>
<p>The newer theory of international law, whether it is regarded as <br/>positivist or not, adheres to the validity of the phrase<i> Pacta sunt servanda. <br/></i>This is hardly surprising, since any other view would amount to denying <br/>the existence of international law in general. However, the law of nations <br/>is built less upon customary law than upon contracts essentially. If a <br/>contract, validly concluded, were not binding, then international law would <br/>be deprived of a decisive foundation and a society of states would not <br/>longer be possible. International law, and with it also the sanctity of con&#173;<br/>tracts, results by a natural necessity from the inevitability of social <br/>intercourse. The binding force of contracts is an obligation which <br/>exists, not only<i> vis-a-vis</i> the contracting parties, but also<i> vis-a-vis</i> the inter&#173;<br/>national community as a whole.88 In the system of international law, <br/>which stands over states, the sanctity of contracts is not to be rationalized <br/>away. <br/></p>
<p>We shall concern ourselves no further with the general foundations of <br/>international law, as such a discussion would go beyond the framework of <br/>the present study. It is important to ascertain, however, upon what legal <br/>sources the maxim<i> Pacta sunt servanda</i> rests, according to the international <br/>law now in force. <br/></p>
<p>For those who believe that the &quot;general principles of law&quot; form a third <br/>source of international law, which is not limited to the jurisdictional system <br/>of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the principle of the <br/>sanctity of contracts is such a general legal principle.8* It is found in <br/><i>foro domestico,</i> as we have seen, in all countries. It is one of the most <br/>important general principles of law for the relations between nations. <br/>Without the powerful instrument of the contract, no international law <br/>is possible.85 As this writer is an adherent of the application, carefully <br/>adapted and taking into account social necessity, of natural law to inter&#173;<br/>national relationships, the idea that the sanctity of contracts rests on a <br/>general principle of law seems especially evident.88 <br/></p>
<p>This principle is, however, also a part of customary law. Certainly, the <br/>phrase<i> Pacta sunt servanda,</i> in the first instance, had a religious origin, <br/></p>

<p>as was pointed out in the first part of this paper. With time, however, it <br/>was integrated into international law, and it can now be described as a part <br/>of customary law.87 The usage<i> (consuetudo)</i> exists&#8212;that is to say, the <br/>application, always repeated, of the principle (in spite of many breaches <br/>of the same)&#8212;in the life of individuals and nations alike. One could even <br/>speak of a &quot;use from time immemorial,&quot; if this were a necessary condition <br/>of custom, which is, however, not the case.38 Likewise the<i> opinio juris <br/>sive necessitatis</i> is given. For governments have always taken the view <br/>that the principle corresponded to their conviction. <br/></p>
<p>No one will deny that many breaches of contract have taken place in <br/>the course of history. The fact that, in spite of this, the principle of the <br/>sanctity of international contracts preserved its validity is indeed remark&#173;<br/>able. Its breach has always been regarded as a wrong which entitles <br/>the wronged party to demand compensation. It must be admitted, in <br/>this connection, that the reparation can only be viewed as an incomplete <br/>compensation for the wrong. For the moral wrong in a breach of contract <br/>is so immense that the material amends cannot possibly give the wronged <br/>party a true reparation. <br/></p>
<p>Numerous declarations have been made by statesmen, in the course of <br/>centuries, to emphasize the obligation to observe the sanctity of contracts.39 <br/></p>
<p>We shall content ourselves here with mentioning two examples: Lord <br/>Russell, British Foreign Minister, in a dispatch dated December 23, 1860, <br/>to the British Ambassador in China, Earl James Bruce Elgin, said that the <br/>universal notions of justice and humanity teach even the worst barbarians <br/>among human beings, that, if an agreement has been made, the law demands <br/>its observance.40 Later the American Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, on <br/>July 16, 1937, in a speech on international affairs, said of American <br/>foreign policy: <br/></p>
<p>We advocate faithful observance of international agreements. Up&#173;<br/>holding the principle of the sanctity of treaties, we believe in modifica&#173;<br/>tion of provisions of treaties, when need therefor arises, by orderly <br/>processes carried out in a spirit of mutual helpfulness and accommoda&#173;<br/>tion. We believe in respect by all nations for the rights of others and <br/>performance by all nations of established obligations.41 <br/></p>

<p>General declarations of many states in favor of the sanctity of contracts <br/>can also be mentioned. One of the most famous is the statement made by <br/>the Powers in the case of the neutralization of the Black Sea, when Russia, <br/>on October 19-31, 1870, suddenly repudiated her obligation, under the <br/>Paris Peace of 1856, to keep in the neutralized Black Sea henceforth only <br/>a fixed number of warships of a fixed tonnage. In the London Protocol of <br/>January 17, 1871, it was said that the representatives of North Germany, <br/>Austro-Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Russia and Turkey, having met in <br/>a conference, recognized as a necessary principle of international law, that <br/>no Power can repudiate the obligations of a contract nor change its provi&#173;<br/>sions without having obtained first the consent of the other contracting <br/>parties by a peaceful understanding.*2 Further, one can read in a com&#173;<br/>munique' of the Atlantic Council of December 16, 1958, in response to the <br/>Russian withdrawal from the provisions of the Inter-Allied Agreement on <br/>Berlin, that <br/></p>
<p>no State has the right, by itself, to free itself unilaterally from its <br/>contractual obligations. The Council declares that such a procedure <br/>destroys the mutual trust between nations which represents one of the <br/>foundations of peace.*8 <br/></p>
<p>Moreover, the treaties which emphasize especially the sanctity of con&#173;<br/>tracts are extraordinarily numerous. Here, also, a few examples will <br/>suffice. The preamble of the Covenant of the League of Nations character&#173;<br/>izes as an important fundamental principle, in order to promote interna&#173;<br/>tional co-operation and to achieve international peace and security, the rule <br/>of &quot;scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized <br/>peoples with one another.&quot; ** In the preamble of the Charter of the United <br/>Nations one finds likewise, &quot;respect for the obligations arising from <br/>treaties and other sources of international law.&quot; Not less important is <br/>the reference in Article 5 of the Charter of the Organization of American <br/>States that international order is based, among other things, on the faithful <br/>fulfillment of the obligations arising from treaties and from other sources <br/>of international law. <br/></p>
<p>Thus, it is easily understandable that no arbitral tribunal has ever re&#173;<br/>jected the rule<i> Pacta sunt servanda,</i> or even thrown doubt on it.*6 On the <br/>other hand, cases are numerous in which international arbitration tribunals <br/>have expressly emphasized and recognized the rule.*8 Here also we will <br/>limit ourselves to a few examples. <br/></p>

<p>In his decision of April 7, 1875, the U. S. Ambassador in Santiago, as <br/>sole arbitrator in the dispute between Chile and Peru, held: <br/></p>
<p>I t is a principle well established in international law that a treaty <br/>containing all elements of validity cannot be modified except by the <br/>same authority and according to the same procedure as those which <br/>have given birth to it.47 <br/></p>
<p>In the case of Ch. Adr. van Bokkelen, between the United States and <br/>Haiti, the arbitrator, A. Porter Morse, in his decision of December 4, 1888, <br/>stated: <br/></p>
<p>Treaties of every kind, when made by the competent authority, are <br/>as obligatory upon nations as private contracts are binding upon in&#173;<br/>dividuals . . . and to be kept with the most scrupulous good faith.48 <br/></p>
<p>In the Newfoundland controversy between the United States and Great <br/>Britain, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague held, in its <br/>award of September 7, 1910: <br/></p>
<p>Every State has to execute the obligations incurred by treaty<i> bona <br/>fide,</i> and is urged thereto by the ordinary sanctions of international law <br/>in regard to observance of treaty obligations.49 <br/></p>
<p>In its first Advisory Opinion on July 31, 1922, on the designation of the <br/>workers' delegate to the International Labor Conference, the Permanent <br/>Court of International Justice emphasized that a contractual obligation <br/>was not merely &quot; a mere moral obligation&quot; but was an &quot;obligation by <br/>which, in law, the parties to the treaty are bound to one another.' 'B0 <br/></p>
<p>Later on, the International Court of Justice, in its Advisory Opinion of <br/>May 28, 1951, on Reservations to the Genocide Convention, stated that <br/>&quot;none of the contracting parties is entitled to frustrate or impair, by means <br/>of unilateral decisions or particular agreements, the purpose and<i> raison <br/>d'etre</i> of the convention.&quot; &quot; <br/></p>
<p>In his statement following the Judgment of the International Court of <br/>Justice of November 28, 1958, in the case concerning the Application of <br/>the Convention of 1902 Governing the Guardianship of Infants<i> (Nether&#173;<br/>lands</i> v.<i> Sweden),</i> the Soviet Judge, Mr. Kojevnikov, expressly based his <br/>opinion on the principle,<i> Pacta sunt servanda;</i>52 the Mexican Judge, <br/>Mr. Cordova, in his dissenting opinion, referred to the rule as &quot; a time-<br/>honoured and basic principle,&quot;68 and he was obviously, on<i> this</i> point, in <br/>agreement with the Judgment of the majority of the Court. <br/></p>

<p>&quot;We have described above the rule of<i> Pacta sunt servanda</i> as a general <br/>principle of law that is found in all nations. It follows, therefore, that <br/>the principle is valid exactly in the same manner, whether it is in respect <br/>of contracts between states or in respect of contracts between states and <br/>private companies. Whether one regards, with Verdross,54 the contracts of <br/>a state with a foreign company for the purpose of granting a concession as <br/>being quasi-international law agreements, or whether one ascribes to them <br/>another character, the principle of the sanctity of contracts must always <br/>be applied. <br/></p>
<p>As has been pointed above, the principle of sanctity of contracts is an <br/>essential condition of the life of any social community. The life of the <br/>international community. is based not only on relations between states, <br/>but also, to an ever-increasing degree, on relations between states and <br/>foreign corporations or foreign individuals. No economic relations be&#173;<br/>tween states and foreign corporations can exist without the principle<i> Pacta <br/>sunt servanda.</i> This has never been disputed in practice. The best proof <br/>that the principle also applies in such a case is the following fact: it has <br/>long been suggested that disputes between states and foreign companies <br/>(or foreign individuals) should be submitted to international adjudica&#173;<br/>tion. Such a course would be meaningless if the principle<i> Pacta sunt <br/>servanda</i> were not applicable also to that kind of relations. How would <br/>it be possible to suggest the creation of such an International Court of <br/>Justice if contracts between a state and a foreign company were not bind&#173;<br/>ing ? The conclusion is thus inescapable that in each case, as Verdross has <br/>shown,55 such contracts are subject to the general principle of law:<i> Pacta <br/>sunt servanda. <br/></i></p>
